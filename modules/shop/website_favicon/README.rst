Icon for Odoo website
=====================

This module allows to put a custom icon in website/e-commerce part of Odoo.

It also includes icons for iOS web clip, Android Chrome and Windows 8 tile.

**NOTE**: The backend part still keeps the same icon. To replace it, use
*web_favicon* module.

Configuration
=============

Go to static/src/icon, and replace each of the existing PNG file with yours.

You can generate them easily from a master PNG (take
*master_original_favicon.png* as sample) from the site
http://realfavicongenerator.net.

There's also a *master_original_favicon.svg* vector file for mastering the
design of your icon.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Let the user select the icon in backend configuration.
